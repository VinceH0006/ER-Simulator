# ER-Simulator

# This program simulates an emergency room priority list.
# Taking in patients and treating them as possible in an order that makes sense. (critical patients first)

# A rather simple algorithm creates 3 lines from an imput file and returns the action performed at each step to the console.

# This is simply an exercise in proper usage and management of a queue system.
